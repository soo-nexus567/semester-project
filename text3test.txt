Ethical and practical considerations in deploying large-scale language models have drawn increasing scrutiny due to their environmental impact, potential misuse, and reinforcement of social biases. Training state-of-the-art transformer models demands substantial computational resources, resulting in high energy consumption and corresponding carbon emissions. Initiatives advocating model distillation, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and responsible reporting of energy metrics aim to mitigate this footprint. Furthermore, open-source governance frameworks and ethical guidelines emphasize transparency, user consent, and bias mitigation. Engaging multidisciplinary stakeholders—including ethicists, domain experts, and end users—is essential to ensure that NLP technologies are developed and adopted responsibly
